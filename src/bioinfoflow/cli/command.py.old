This file has been refactored into multiple modules.

The CLI functionality has been divided into multiple modules:
- cli_core.py - Core CLI setup and utilities
- commands/run.py - Run workflow command
- commands/list.py - List workflow runs command 
- commands/status.py - Status command
- commands/db.py - Database commands
- commands/serve.py - API server command

This file remains only for backwards compatibility and will be removed in a future version.
